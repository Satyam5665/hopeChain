# The problem hopeChain solves:
This project helps the donators to directly transfer money from their account to the needy person's account. This project being completely decentralized makes it corruption free and Secure. Since there is no middle man role, whole money gets transferred to the needy person's account.

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node![c3b9ebf3-1e34-4e0e-b1b7-ae4ecdf2f768](https://github.com/Satyam5665/hopeChain/assets/96643434/23c53f59-0fd1-4804-ab6d-abe36ef41565)

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
